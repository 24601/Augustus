# Agent self-assessment with Jev

Pattern class: use Jev as the agent's own supervisor — a narrow, fast loop
watching the wide generative loop. Launch-week implementations converged on
the same lifecycle; the numbers below are their measured recipes (dated
2026-09-16/18, jev-1.13.0). Re-verify against repos in the archive before
relying: foreman, pi-jev, pi-warden, winnow, fast-jev-compaction, jev-judgment.

## Lifecycle gates

1. **Pre-action gate** (before any irreversible call). One request, all in
   parallel, thresholded in code: `destructive` (noul, hold ≥0.90),
   `exfiltrates_secrets` (≥0.70), `beyond_request_scope` (≥0.85),
   `impact_if_unwanted` (Score 4 levels, escalate ≥2.5). Ship shadow mode
   first; enforce only after observing real traffic.
2. **Post-action output judge** (after the tool result exists, not before):
   `leaks_secret` (noul ≥0.90) and `failure_class` (Choice ~6 options).
   The gate sees intent; only the output judge sees what the command printed.
3. **Done-check on the final reply**: "done" claimed after code changes
   with no test/build/lint result → block. One Noul, one threshold.
4. **Stuck-detector**: three failures with the same strategy → ask for a
   new hypothesis, not another retry.
5. **Supervision during long runs** (foreman): separate concurrent loop
   estimates `meaningful_progress`, `implementation_complete`,
   `tests_sufficient`, `worker_stuck`, `work_off_track`,
   `ready_to_finish`; deterministic policy with hysteresis (retry counts,
   verification history) gates continue/stop/retry/verify. The model never
   commands; it estimates named probabilities.
6. **Context economy**: judge every large tool result with one relevance
   Noul before it enters context. Hide confident-no blocks behind a stub +
   recall key; always keep current instruction, recent turns, errors, and
   opaque blocks (thinking/signatures/media). winnow hides at relevance
   ≤0.22; fast-jev-compaction asks two nouls per tool call (should the call
   stay knowing it was made? should the result stay verbatim?).

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- A Jev probability is evidence about context, never an action permit.
  Operation+target pairs are validated in code; "confidence high" does not
  authorize.
- Every error path fails open (missing key, timeout, 429, malformed
  response → no verdict, tool call proceeds, error reported once/minute).
- Cache identical judgments (~120s) and deduplicate sibling calls into one
  in-flight request.
- pi-warden measured cost makes continuous guarding viable: ~$0.00004 and
  ~0.3s per judgment on 17,160 guarded calls; 150 paired runs broke project
  rules 6 times with it off, 0 times on. Your numbers will differ — measure.

## Hallucination/grounding/citation checks

- Grounding of a generated claim: one Choice per claim–evidence pair
  (supports / contradicts / unrelated) + a confidence review flag; judge
  against the cited source text, never against another model's prose.
- Self-report fidelity: compare the agent's claimed action with its actual
  trace via decomposed Nouls (right tool? args match schema? result matches
  call?). Escalate on low confidence; never auto-retry.
- Rubric quality: if scores are the data type, use concrete level
  descriptions (never bare degrees or "worse than previous"), independent
  dimensions as separate Scores, and read probabilities beside every score.

## Using Jev to test and optimize the skill suite itself

- Treat the skill directory as a routing problem: rank all frontmatter
  descriptions against the live request (Choice), gate whether anything
  fits (nouls), then rerank the top-3 with full bodies and reject-allowed
  fits-nouls. Measured reference points: gate ≥0.30 mean, winner fits ≥0.40,
  shortlist 3, 700-char excerpts, 240 skills per request; 94.4% routing on
  synthetic requests vs 70.8% lexical baseline (GodsBoy, exploratory).
- Callability tests per skill: does its description route to itself under
  (a) literal trigger phrasing, (b) user paraphrase, (c) a near-miss
  neighbor skill present? Run as batched Choice questions over descriptions.
- Distinct descriptions are a retrieval feature — lookalike descriptions
  were the top failure source in the official skill_suggestion cookbook.
  Rewrite frontmatter like Choice criteria (what / not_for / examples).
