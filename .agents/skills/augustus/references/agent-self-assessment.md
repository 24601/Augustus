# Agent self-assessment with Jev

Pattern class: use Jev as the agent's own supervisor — a narrow, fast loop
watching the wide generative loop. Launch-week implementations converged on
the same lifecycle; the numbers below are their measured recipes (dated
2026-09-16/18, jev-1.13.0). Re-verify against repos in the archive before
relying: foreman, pi-jev, pi-warden, winnow, fast-jev-compaction, jev-judgment.

## Lifecycle gates

1. **Pre-action gate** (before any irreversible call). One request, all in
   parallel, thresholded in code: `destructive` (noul, hold ≥0.90),
   `exfiltrates_secrets` (≥0.70), `beyond_request_scope` (≥0.85),
   `impact_if_unwanted` (Score 4 levels, escalate ≥2.5). Ship shadow mode
   first; enforce only after observing real traffic.
2. **Post-action output judge** (after the tool result exists, not before):
   `leaks_secret` (noul ≥0.90) and `failure_class` (Choice ~6 options).
   The gate sees intent; only the output judge sees what the command printed.
3. **Done-check on the final reply**: "done" claimed after code changes
   with no test/build/lint result → block. Structure first: whether a
   test/build/lint result exists in the trace is countable, so code
   answers it — one Noul only for the semantic remainder ("does this
   reply claim the work is finished?"), one threshold. Spending the model
   on the countable half is the `/bin/ls`-as-first-tier pattern
   (`mappings.md` §18).
4. **Stuck-detector**: three failures with the same strategy → ask for a
   new hypothesis, not another retry.
5. **Supervision during long runs** (foreman): separate concurrent loop
   estimates `meaningful_progress`, `implementation_complete`,
   `tests_sufficient`, `worker_stuck`, `work_off_track`,
   `ready_to_finish`; deterministic policy with hysteresis (retry counts,
   verification history) gates continue/stop/retry/verify. The model never
   commands; it estimates named probabilities. Same split as
   [jev-reflex-autonomy-lab](https://github.com/khordoo/jev-reflex-autonomy-lab):
   **S1 keeps control**; optional S2 is one-use advice on low confidence
   and does not fly the drone (`notes.md` §46). Experimental viz, not a
   production supervisor.
6. **Context economy**: the context-sieve card
   (`references/applied-mappings.md#1-context-sieve`). Judge every large
   tool result with one relevance Noul before it enters context. Hide
   confident-no blocks behind a stub + recall key; always keep current
   instruction, recent turns, errors, and opaque blocks. winnow hides at
   relevance ≤0.22; fast-jev-compaction asks two nouls per tool call
   (should the call stay knowing it was made? should the result stay
   verbatim?).

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- A Jev probability is evidence about context, never an action permit.
  Operation+target pairs are validated in code; "confidence high" does not
  authorize.
- Error paths fail **per action**. These supervision gates are advisory,
  so they fail open (missing key, timeout, 429, malformed response → no
  verdict, tool call proceeds, error reported once/minute) — and that is
  only safe because a hard interlock or sandbox sits underneath. A gate
  that *selects* or *authorizes* a side effect fails closed instead
  (`mixed-architecture.md` prefilter table; `mappings.md` §18).
- Cache identical judgments (~120s) and deduplicate sibling calls into one
  in-flight request.
- pi-warden measured cost makes continuous guarding viable: ~$0.00004 and
  ~0.3s per judgment on 17,160 guarded calls; 150 paired runs broke project
  rules 6 times with it off, 0 times on. Your numbers will differ — measure.

## Hallucination/grounding/citation checks

- Grounding of a generated claim: one Choice per claim–evidence pair
  (supports / contradicts / unrelated) + a confidence review flag; judge
  against the cited source text, never against another model's prose.
- Self-report fidelity: compare the agent's claimed action with its actual
  trace via decomposed Nouls (right tool? args match schema? result matches
  call?). Escalate on low confidence; never auto-retry.
- Rubric quality: if scores are the data type, use concrete level
  descriptions (never bare degrees or "worse than previous"), independent
  dimensions as separate Scores, and read probabilities beside every score.

## Preference lint (project rules, not taste)

When the "judge" is really "does this change violate a rule we already
wrote?", do not ask Jev whether the code is good. Load
`references/mixed-architecture.md#preference-lint-and-gates`. The transferable
contract (`doeixd/jev-pref`): the project defines the rule, Jev classifies
visible evidence, code maps the outcome, the agent acts. Shadow-mode the gate
first; permit remains a separate axis from confidence.

## Using Jev to test and optimize the skill suite itself

- Treat the skill directory as a routing problem: rank all frontmatter
  descriptions against the live request (Choice), gate whether anything
  fits (nouls), then rerank the top-3 with full bodies and reject-allowed
  fits-nouls. Measured reference points: gate ≥0.30 mean, winner fits ≥0.40,
  shortlist 3, 700-char excerpts, 240 skills per request; 94.4% routing on
  synthetic requests vs 70.8% lexical baseline (GodsBoy, exploratory).
- Callability tests per skill: does its description route to itself under
  (a) literal trigger phrasing, (b) user paraphrase, (c) a near-miss
  neighbor skill present? Run as batched Choice questions over descriptions.
- Distinct descriptions are a retrieval feature — lookalike descriptions
  were the top failure source in the official skill_suggestion cookbook.
  Rewrite frontmatter like Choice criteria (what / not_for / examples).
- **Judge variance before judge trust** (danielgshea/jev-as-a-judge, 100
  repetitions over frozen outputs, jev-1.13.0): a Jev judge's repeated
  ratings varied 224× less on a quality metric and 279× less on a rubric
  than a generative LLM judge's, with 0% outcome disagreement. A judge that
  is consistent is one you can threshold; a judge that moves between runs
  is noise you cannot gate. Any grader used to test a skill — Jev or LLM —
  gets this variance check first, over frozen outputs, before its numbers
  mean anything.
- Gate vocabulary is converging across implementations; reuse it rather
  than inventing: allow / ask_human / deny (toolgate), ok / retry /
  escalate / stop (harnessjudge). Same shape as the lifecycle gates above.
